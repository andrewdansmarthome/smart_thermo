# Smart Thermostat!

Building out a smart thermostat to replace our mechanical one at the apartment. Currently in a web-enabled thermometer state. Next steps to get it closer to working how it should:

1. Implement websockets
2. Implement scheduler
3. Add a basic UI with controls
4. Add temp history graph to UI

Let's get on it!
